*delaunay* is a Lua module for [delaunay triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) of a convex polygon.

## Installation
Copy the file [delaunay.lua](http://raw.github.com/Yonaba/delaunay/master/delaunay.lua) inside your project folder,
call it with [require](http://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/require) function. It will return the `Delaunay` module, keeping safe the global environment.<br/>

## Usage

The module provides 3 classes: <br/> 
* `Point`
* `Edge`
* `Triangle`

It also provides a single function named `triangulate`. This function accepts
a variable list (*vararg* `...`) of instances of class `Point`. Assuming those 
points are the vertices of a convex polygon, it returns a table of instances of the class `Triangle` forming a *Delaunay triangulation* of the given polygon.

A basic code example:
```lua
local Delaunay = require 'Delaunay'
local Point    = Delaunay.Point

-- Creating 10 random points
local points = {}
for i = 1, 10 do
  points[i] = Point(math.random() * 100, math.random() * 100)
end

-- Triangulating de convex polygon made by those points
local triangles = Delaunay.triangulate(unpack(points))

-- Printing the results
for i, triangle in ipairs(triangles) do
  print(triangle)
end
````
